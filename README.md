# Daniel

Daniel is a [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core) serialization helper meant to be used in Web context.
With Daniel adding support for JSON, Smile, XML, YAML input and outputs is very straightforward which allows the
developer to focus on the meat of the project.

All (de)serialization is controlled by [Jackson Annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations).
If performance is of concern, considering including [Jackson Afterburner](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-afterburner)
