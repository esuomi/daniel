# Cradle - a Gradle project template

Base template to use for Gradle projects. Sort of similar to eg. Netflix' [gradle-template](https://github.com/Netflix/gradle-template), only more lightweight and suited to my personal needs.

The master branch will never contain anything useful. Look for versioned branches for actual content.
