# Daniel - _The_ Object Translator

Daniel is a [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core) serialization helper meant to be used in Web context.
With Daniel adding support for JSON, Smile, XML, YAML and CBOR input and outputs is very straightforward which allows 
the developer to focus on the meat of the project.

All (de)serialization is controlled by [Jackson Annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations).
